The  Second  best  model  is  Model 7  with  an  AIC  of  235.1489 
 But  Using  the  Adjusted  R-squared  values,
 Model3  has  an Adjusted  R-squared  value  of  0.9928
Model7  has  an Adjusted  R-squared  value  of  0.9925
 The  overall  best  model  is  the  model3  with  the  linear  regression  equation:
Y=-2.440e^6-1.501A_3-0.9340A_4-0.2262A_5+1299A_6
